        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Hot Beans Web is a web development company based in England that was established in 2010 by Philip Heinz. The company was born out of Philip's passion for web development and his desire to create his ideal website, which he felt he couldn't find elsewhere. The unique name, Hot Beans Web, was inspired by Philip's second name, Heinz.
          <br>
          <br>
          The company started as a small group of about five individuals, each with their own unique skills and abilities. Over the years, the team has grown and now includes several dedicated professionals who work tirelessly to create high-quality websites for a variety of businesses, both small and large.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hot Beans Web prides itself on designing websites with both the business and end user in mind. The team works closely with customers to create personalized websites that help them achieve their goals and grow their businesses. They strive to provide excellent customer service and to produce the highest quality websites possible.
          <br>
          <br>
          One of the key aspects of Hot Beans Web's approach is their emphasis on creativity. The company encourages its web developers to test and implement their ideas, fostering an environment of innovation and continuous improvement. This approach has been appreciated by the team members, with one of the developers, Jack, expressing his enjoyment of the creative freedom provided by the company.
